How to write a research paper
=============================

* don't wait: write the paper, then do the research and experiments to fill in the blanks
* very clearly identify your key idea/contribution/solution
* put the related work at the end and give references to it throughout the paper
* put your readers first (examples)
* listen to your reviewers


Writing is a mechanism for "doing" the research. not just reporting it.
fallacy: the idea must be good. bad ideas make good research! Write the paper anyway!


listen to your readers:
  get volunteers to read your paper
  but they can only read your paper once for the first time
  reviewing your paper is a gift.
  "what I want to know is where it stops being worth reading"
  in extreme moderation: "could you help me ensure that I am describing your work fairly?"
  how can I rewrite that section so that not even the most impatient reviewer will misunderstand it?


Research paper terms
====================

"claims"
  or contributions are the problems you intend to solve in the paper.
  keep the problem specific and achievable.
    do not make huge broad claims about the problem you will solve.
  it must be a useful and re-usable idea
  but, the claims MUST be refutable.. it must be possible to fail to deliver on them.
    they must be facts that can be proven true or false with "evidence"
    "I will study x" and "I will discribe Y" and "we have used Z" are not refutable

"evidence"
  evidence can be analysis, comparison, theorems, measurements, case studies


Research paper structure
========================

(the whole paper should work together to tell a story)

title (1000 readers)
  ?????

abstract (4 sentences, 100 readers)
  here is a problem
    it's an interesting problem
    it's an unsolved problem
  here is my idea/claim/contribution
    your paper should have only 1 clear, sharp, specific, idea
    if you have lots of ideas, write lots of papers.
  my idea works (details, data)

introduction (1 page 100 readers)
  describe the problem with an example
  bullet list of the claims with forward references to the evidence

the problem (1 page 10 readers)
  explain the intuition first as if speaking at the whiteboard... examples are good.

my idea( 2 pages 10 readers)
  "the main idea of this paper is..."
  "in this section we present the main contributions of the paper."

the details( 5 pages, 3 readers)
  choose the most direct route to the idea
    don't spend time explaining an approach that did not work.. maybe in related work???
      don't force the reader down all the dead ends you had to go through to find the idea/solution
        your sweat, blood, and tears are not interesting to the reader
    but do note why very obvious solutions won't work to keep the reader from being distracted.
  give forward references to related work

related work(1-2 pages, 10 readers)
  the rest of the paper forms a lense (assumptions and definitions) for viewing the related work
  giving credit to others does NOT diminish the credit you get from your paper
  warmly acknowledge pwople who have helped you
  acknowledge weaknesses in your approach. better on x, but worse on y. explain the tradeoffs

conclusions and further work(0.5 pages)
